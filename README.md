=========

AuthPanel is supposed to be a very lite weight code based authencation system.


#ChangeLog:#
	- [x] Added site salt support to the make code and the check code.
	- [x] Made it very easy to include authpanel config / functions via: require_once('./includes/config.php');
	- [x] Added a .Htaccess for the includes folder, I have it block all access but, localhost for testing and sever sided script calls.
	- [x] Make code Visualy appealing
	- [x] Optimize code


#Coders note:#
	I have updated the authpanel to version 1.0.3 and made it a class file instead of an api.
